LaTeX-Boilerplate
=================

This is the default structure I use for LaTeX writings. It includes various
useful examples (floats, bibliography, appendices) and tweaks.

To use it, simply clone this repository or
[download](https://github.com/adrianp/latex-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) the
code; you can safely delete the `.git` directory afterwards (assuming that you
do not want to
[contribute back](https://github.com/adrianp/latex-boilerplate/pulls)); anyway,
fell free to report
[issues](https://github.com/adrianp/latex-boilerplate/issues).

You can compile everything using your preferred method, but do not forget about
the [BibTeX](http://bibtex.org) incantation (latex, bibtex, latex, latex). My
preferred method is
[latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/), as this is
the default in [LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box). I also
included a cleanup script to remove all unwanted compilation fallout.

Happy writing!
