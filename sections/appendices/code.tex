The source code deliverables of the project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The main contributions have already been merged for inclusion in the
    next version of Invenio, and can be found online at
    \url{http://invenio-software.org/repo/personal/invenio-apanescu}. Note that
    the \texttt{pu} (\textit{``Proposed Updates''}) branch refers to the next
    Invenio version, while the \texttt{labs} branch is used for the
    Labs demonstrator. A total of 79 commits with approximately 6000 lines of
    code added or modified  were recorded by the Git version control system,
    out of which 3600 lines in 6 commits represent the new annotation
    facilities. A mirror of this repository can also be found at
    \url{http://github.com/adrianp/invenio}.
  \item The contributions brought to the separate package used for deploying
    customised Invenio installations can be found at
    \url{http://github.com/adrianp/invenio-demosite}. Of interest is the
    \texttt{labs} branch, used for Invenio Labs.
  \item The Python 2.6 compatible version of the JSON-LD manipulation library,
    PyLD, used for running the Invenio Labs demonstrator, is available at
    \url{http://github.com/adrianp/pyld} (see \texttt{python2.6} branch).
  \item The customised version of the JavaScript library used for the Invenio
    Labs interactive tutorial, Intro.js, can be found at
    \url{http://github.com/adrianp/intro.js} (see \texttt{inveniolabs} branch).
    A bug fix has been accepted by the library authors and merged upstream, see
    \url{http://github.com/usablica/intro.js/pull/236}.
