This appendix summarises the source code deliverables of the project.

All contributions of the project have already been merged for inclusion in
the next version of Invenio, and can be found online at
\url{http://invenio-software.org/repo/personal/invenio-apanescu}. Note that the
\texttt{pu} (\textit{``Proposed Updates''}) branch refers to the next Invenio
version, while the \texttt{labs} branch is used for the Invenio Labs
demonstrator.

As recorded by the Git source code control system, 79 commits, with 5948
additions and 1770 deletions were delivered. Out of these, 6 commits, with
3431 additions and 182 deletions, represent the annotation facilities, along
with the document previewer and other auxiliary components.

At \url{http://github.com/adrianp/invenio-demosite} the contributions
brought to the separate package used for deploying customised Invenio
installations can be found. Of interest is the \texttt{labs} branch, used for
Invenio Labs.

Two external software libraries have been maintained in order to fit the
project's requirements. These are PyLD (\url{http://github.com/adrianp/pyld}),
which was patched in order to function with the Python 2.6 version used for
Invenio Labs (see \texttt{python2.6} branch), and Intro.js
(\url{http://github.com/adrianp/intro.js}), a JavaScript library used for the
Invenio Labs interactive tutorial feature (see \texttt{inveniolabs} branch).
A bug fix for Intro.js has been accepted by the library authors and merged
upstream (see \url{http://github.com/usablica/intro.js/pull/236}).
