Starting from the requirements and abstract design presented in the previous
section, an implementation of the Invenio annotation facility was proposed,
the next subsections detailing its various aspects.

It is worth noting that due to various constraints, the project started by
implementing the targeted document annotation facility, which built upon the
existing SQL based backend already used for record commenting. The first
iteration was deployed on Invenio Labs, in order to gather information about
possible issues and shortcomings of the design from end-users. Using the
experience gained during this process, the general annotation framework was
developed and the targeted commenting facilities adapted to using it, this
including moving from the SQL backend to a JSON document store based one.

Nonetheless, the description of the developed components will follow the more
logical top--down approach, from the highest level of abstraction to the more
specific use-cases.
