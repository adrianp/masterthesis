As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:oa}, an important capability of most
annotation systems is metadata dissemination. An example use case, related to
the targeted annotation feature, is the routine employed by certain high energy
physics collaborations, which use both CDS and an external application
(TWiki) for their paper review process. Thus, the possibility of transferring
data between applications in a standardised manner could simplify both the
users' workflow and the development process for application providers.

An API that allows exporting annotation data from the Invenio platform has been
implemented and will be described in Subsection \ref{sec:pub}. The system uses
the Open Annotation data model for creating standardised RDF graphs describing
annotations, and exports them using the JSON-LD serialisation format; a brief
description of JSON-LD follows.
