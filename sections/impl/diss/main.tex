As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:oa}, an important capability of most
annotation systems is the dissemination of metadata across systems. An example
related to the targeted annotation use case is the routine employed by certain
high energy physics collaborations, which use both CDS and an external wiki
application (TWiki) for their paper review needs. Thus, the possibility of
transferring data between applications in a standardised manner could simplify
both the workflow of the users and the development process of application
providers.

An API that allows exporting annotation data from the Invenio platform has been
implemented and will be described in Subsection \ref{sec:pub}. The system uses
the Open Annotation data model for creating standardised RDF graphs describing
annotations, and exports them using the JSON-LD serialisation format; a brief
description of JSON-LD follows in next subsection.
