The aim of this project was to develop a structured annotation facility, the
original use-case being identified in the scientific paper pre-publication
workflow employed by high energy physics collaborations on the CERN Document
Server. Apart from being able to comment at the global document level,
reviewers also require more granular options, such as section, paragraph,
figure, or equation targeted annotations. Moreover, aggregating such
reviews should be possible in a facile manner, which would simplify the
workflow for the authors in charge of amending papers.

After a study of basic use cases and state of the art solutions and related
technologies, a general annotation framework for the Invenio digital library
platform was designed and implemented. The aim was to provide a standardised
method of allowing input of end-user generated data regardless of its form:
document comments, record collections and tags, or Web page annotations.

The targeted annotator facility was implemented along with a document
previewer, which facilitates both data input and aggregation for end-users.
Furthermore, a method of disseminating annotations, in line with the Open
Annotation RDF data model, was implemented. This makes use of modern Web
technologies such as the JSON-LD serialisation format and REST services, in
order to bestow a streamlined circulation workflow for any third-party
interested in accessing user-generated metadata.

The annotation facilities were developed in the context of the new Invenio
digital library platform version, to which the project brought a number of
additional contributions, such as fixes and improvements of existing
components.  The document targeted annotator was released to end users for
testing in a controlled environment, the feedback being highly positive. The
general consensus is that the new aggregation features significantly simplify
the pre-publication review process; future improvements, such as the ones
presented in Section \ref{sec:future}, might improve the workflow even further.
