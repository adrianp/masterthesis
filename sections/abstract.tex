This project aimed at enhancing the scientific user community features related
to shared commenting and annotating of scientific literature and data
resources.  The current commenting practices in digital repositories often
cover global, per-document commenting options only. Within the Large Hadron
Collider experiment collaborations at CERN, more targeted needs include
per-section, per-line, or per data item commenting granularity.

In the context of Invenio, a digital library platform originating in the
high-energy physics community, a framework which allows annotating various
types of data resources has been developed. By leveraging it, a general Web
page annotator, and a targeted document commenting system, which allows
referring to specific elements such as pages, sections, figures or mathematical
equations have been delivered.

State of the art solutions have been employed, in order to deliver solutions
which are in line with current Web application practices. The framework
includes a RESTful annotation dissemination mechanism, which adheres to
standard specifications such as Open Annotation and JSON-LD.
