The aim of the project is to enhance scientific user community features related
to shared commenting and annotating of scientific literature and data
resources.  The current commenting practices in digital repositories often
cover global, per-document commenting options only. Within the LHC experiment
collaborations at CERN, more targeted needs include per-section, per-line, or
per data item commenting granularity. Considering the high-energy physics
community use case, the goal of this project is to develop a web application
that can allow users to:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Annotate parts of scientific documents and data objects;
  \item Create enhanced visual representations of scientific papers and data
        objects with aggregated comments and annotations of user community;
  \item Share comments and annotations between heterogeneous literature and data
        resources.
\end{enumerate}

The project will use the high-energy physics community use case and the Invenio
digital library platform, and may include cross-linking of services such as the
CERN document server, INSPIRE, Indico, TWiki, or Drupal, via the W3C Open
Annotation framework.
