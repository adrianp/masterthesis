FIXME: general description, Inspire, Zenodo

Invenio is a software suite which allows running an online document repository
or digital library. Its features cover all aspects of such repositories,
including document ingestion, classification, indexing, curation and
dissemination \cite{ref:invenio}.

Invenio complies with domain-specific standards such as the Open Archives
Initiative met}data harvesting protocol. This is a low-barrier mechanism for
repository interoperability, in which HTTP requests can be made to providers in
order to request bibliographic record metadata \cite{ref:oai}.

Invenio is built using the Python programming language and currently supports
the MySQL relational database. Records are represented internally using a XML
derivative of the MARC 21 bibliographic format, which is widely used for the
representation and exchange of bibliographic, authority, holdings,
classification, and community information data in machine-readable form
\cite{ref:marc}.
